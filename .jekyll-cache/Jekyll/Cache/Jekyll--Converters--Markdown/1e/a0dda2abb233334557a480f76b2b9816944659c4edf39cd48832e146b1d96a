I"•<h1 id="images">Images!</h1>

<p>I just found a really nice little extension for VS Code that will dump a pasted image into a folder for you. This should make it much easier to add images to stuff here. It also drops a link to that uploaded file into your Markdown document. Very smooth once I got it configured correctly (it worked out of the box, but I set up some paths for the destination folder and the Markdown text that is pasted into the file once it saves the image you have pasted).</p>

<p>The extension is <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image">Paste Image</a>.</p>

<p>I found it on this page, which I was using to procrastinate from actually writing: <a href="https://diessi.ca/blog/writing-mode-in-vs-code/">Writing Mode in VS Code - https://diessi.ca/</a></p>

<p>And, hereâ€™s an image:</p>
