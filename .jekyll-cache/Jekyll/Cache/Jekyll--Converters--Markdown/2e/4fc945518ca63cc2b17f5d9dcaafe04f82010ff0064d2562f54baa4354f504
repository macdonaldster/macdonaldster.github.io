<p>â€œSome days are diamonds, some days are stone.â€ â€“ Dick Feller https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Days_Are_Diamonds_%28Some_Days_Are_Stone%29</p>

<p>Living with chronic pain is a bit of a roller coaster. I try to stay even and positive but sometimes I have to just give in and let yourself wallow in self-pity. Itâ€™s like taking a break from the fight to get ready for the next round. I donâ€™t want to do this too often, and I donâ€™t want other people to see it, but I need to do it from time to time. In my mind, I am convinced when I get sick, I will also eventually get better. But that isnâ€™t always the case. The fortunate thing is this isnâ€™t killing me so I tend to get past that most days and get my work done.</p>

<p>Today, though, is one of those days where I am feeling sorry for myself. My legs arenâ€™t working. I mean they are, I can walk, but walking is slow and painful. The inside of my right thigh is locked in some kind of permanent cramp and feels like it wonâ€™t move and is weak. My left leg is mostly OK in comparison. I get it, I could be in a wheelchair. That is what I tell myself most days but today all I can think about is â€œI could also be running 5k in the morning before workâ€. Maybe I would if I was â€œnormalâ€. I really miss running.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know what the answer is so after my allowed period of self-pity I will snap out of it, get my chin up, and carry on.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s the next morning now. My leg is a little better. I can do this.</p>

Whatever was causing that issue has abated and I am able to live more or less normally again. I feel bad about writing that, it was a low point but it reflects reality. Yesterday, in the freezing cold, spontaneously, I was able to take my son and dog tobogganing a short walk from the house. This sounds like nothing but walking in heavy boots in snow, with a 90 lbs. dog on a leash in one hand, and a kidsâ€™s toboggan in the other would have been basically a nightmare a couple weeks ago but yesterday was fun and relaxing. Gotta take the good with the bad, here.</h2>
