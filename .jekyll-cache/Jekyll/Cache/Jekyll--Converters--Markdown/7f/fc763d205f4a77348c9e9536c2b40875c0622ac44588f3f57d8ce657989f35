<p>I freaked out today when I realized I could not find a bunch of Google Calendar entries I knew I had made. Searching seemed to broken. And then I went into Gmail searching for an email with those dates that I knew I had sent and it was gone. This is not the first time this has happened. Now, I know what you are thinking: I am crazy, I never created those events. And I can‚Äôt blame you for thinking that but it is just not the case.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am moving back to what worked for me for years. A paper planner. I am getting an undated planner so I can start it now and not waste half of it. If I like it, I‚Äôll likely get a dated one for the following calendar year.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll see how it goes.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the next day and I don‚Äôt have any real reservations about this. I am going to do it. I use my calendar for a few non-work things. Typically, appointments, trips, and birthdays.</p>

<p>My greatest argument against this is ‚Äúsay I am booking a dentist appointment and I forget I have a thing that day in six months‚Äù. Well, this is something you can easily solve by simply taking the calendar with you OR calling them in there is a conflict. Other than that, I am basically going to be doing a lot of page flipping (looking ahead at the week, etc). This is fine. Recurring things I need reminders of can still go into Google calendar or just as reminders in Gmail. I might even use an Gmail label as my todo list. It‚Äôs fine.</p>

<p>So far the paper calendar is going well. It is self-dated so I added in dates until the end of December. I‚Äôll use the rest of the book (half, or so) for my TODO list. Using a list scanning method from Mark Forster <a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/tm-systems/">http://markforster.squarespace.com/tm-systems/</a>. I can never find the exact one but basically, you have a long list and when you work on something you cross if off. If it isn‚Äôt done you write it at the end of the list after crossing it off. You start scanning at the first page of the list with one or more incomplete tasks. That‚Äôs it.</p>

<p>Here I am about 9 days after the original idea to go to a paper calendar. So far I love it. I haven‚Äôt been totally in love with using the back of it as a task manager, though. I am never really happy with how I manage tasks. Part of me thinks keeping it on paper is just as good as any system. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the fact that I can‚Äôt really settle on a paper format that lets me define tasks but also scribble notes and add little check lists.</p>

<p>For example, I have a long task list in the back of my calendar (it‚Äôs undated, so I am using the pages after Dec 31 as a notebook). I have a task to get bins to organize my freezer. This is really a project. Step 1 - measure freezer to figure out bin size, Step 2 - locate bins that fit and decide what kind to buy and how many, Step 3 - go to store or order online. Now, what I would like is a list of tasks I can scan, with notes, but on paper. What if my system was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>single task, just write a line at the end of the last task list in the notebook, or start a new page if the last page is full</li>
  <li>project, title/date the next blank page and write the project down with notes</li>
</ul>

<p>To scan my list, start at the first page that isn‚Äôt completed and scan from there, also scanning any projects not completed. Add tasks for any projects as single tasks.</p>

<p>I rarely need ‚Äúproject context‚Äù or multiple pages for my projects. Just a few notes. Anything more than that and I might have a separate notebook or maybe a Google doc or spreadsheet going which I could reference in the project page in the notebook (it easy enough to tag things so they are found in a Google Drive search and note that tag on paper, for example).</p>

<p>OK, that is what I will try! Stay tuned.</p>
