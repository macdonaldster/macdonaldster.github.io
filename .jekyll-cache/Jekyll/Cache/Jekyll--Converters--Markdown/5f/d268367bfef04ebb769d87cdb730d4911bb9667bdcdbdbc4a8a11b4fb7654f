<p>I havenâ€™t written her for a while. Not because I donâ€™t have anything to say or I am tired of blogging. I just havenâ€™t felt like anything I am working on is finished enough to write about and Iâ€™ve been limiting the time I spend writing, in general.</p>

<p>To recap the last while:</p>

<ul>
  <li>made pizza in the charcoal grill, excellent</li>
  <li>put up some privacy panels with garden boxes on the desk, really nice</li>
  <li>started eating Oatmeal for breakfast</li>
  <li>garden is coming along</li>
  <li>I am working on an essay for posting here regarding an economy based solely on reputation as the fungible currency. Itâ€™s taking a while.</li>
  <li>we are still in lockdown</li>
  <li>I am trying to get more sleep at night so my personal hobbies and tasks are not getting attention, such is life</li>
</ul>
