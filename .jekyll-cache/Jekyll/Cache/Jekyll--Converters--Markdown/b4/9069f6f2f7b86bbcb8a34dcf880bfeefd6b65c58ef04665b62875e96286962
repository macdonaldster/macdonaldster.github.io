<p>Seems like we get it every night, this summer.</p>

<p>I use an Android app to keep an eye on the storms. It’s hard to explain the interface but it shows you where strikes are happening in near real time on a map at whatever scale you’d like. Great for tracking fast moving lightning storms so you know when it’s safe to head back outside.</p>

<p>Take a look at “Blitzortung Lightning Monitor”: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.blitzortung.android.app">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.blitzortung.android.app</a></p>
