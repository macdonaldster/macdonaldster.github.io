<p>Started the day off with green tea and some Tylenol around 2 hours after being up. I didnâ€™t need any after that, although I do have a slight headache now, as I write this just before bed. I ended up having a short nap after work today and then a half cup of coffee. I felt like that late in the day and such a small amount, it would be OK and it is.</p>

<p>My goal isnâ€™t to â€œquit coffeeâ€, it is to reduce caffeine, possibly to zero. Tapering is the recommended method for getting off coffee, and Iâ€™ve used it successfully in the past.</p>

<p>I found my focus at work today was really good and the day passed without anxious moments (e.g. easy to stay on task, no thinking about anything but work). Thatâ€™s great and should help my productivity a little if that is a consistent effect (could just be I had a good day of working).</p>
