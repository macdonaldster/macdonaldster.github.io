# Tuesday 2020-03-10

I don't have a lot to say other than I have a new Linux box sitting in my office for personal use. I haven't had a personal computer for several years. It feels good. I slowly moving all my stuff from my cheap VPS and my work laptop over to my new server.

This is being composed there using emacs in a SSH session in a Tmux session. :)
