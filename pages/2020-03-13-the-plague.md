# The Plague

When I was younger, one of my favorite books was The Plague by Albert Camus. 

Something about life frozen in statis but also tenuous just captured my imagination. 

I find myself thinking about it all the time now, even though I last read it over 25 years ago. Maybe I should read it again. The thing is, I don't remember how the book ends. Do they make it? Probably, they wrote a book after all.
