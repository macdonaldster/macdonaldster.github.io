# 2020-04-23

I don't have much to say lately. I feel petty when I have frustrations arising from the COVID situation.

What I've been doing lately?

- working
- going out for walks with my son while he rides his bike
- taking the dog on those walks
- actually sitting on the deck
- eating TOO much

What I am planning on doing:

- coffee - I love it, but lately I have been wondering how much my mood is altered by caffeine. Tonight, I put the coffee on for the morning, as I always do, but I also set out a teapot with green tea in it, that I will brew first thing. If I need coffee later in the morning, it will be there. I want to see how things go. I have kicked it before and missed it a little, only going back when I missed it too much. The reset is nice. I can do something like green tea all morning and an espresso after lunch, maybe. I'll see how tomorrow goes.

- food - trying to not eat after 8pm. I know, everyone fasts for 18 hours a day. I am just trying to break the habit of a snack before bed. I want to associate hungry with sleepy. I have the opposite association now and it isn't doing me any favors. 

- work - I need to achieve a balance with also having to be part of a team of two home-schooling and taking care of our son. On days when I can get a lot done, I have to really go for it. Other days, days like today, will not go as well and I need to accept that.

Finally, to wind up today's notes, I am using Emacs again for org-mode and general text editing. It is running on a Linux server but I have an xserver on my workstation meaning I can use the Emacs window as if it were local without having to use a Windows install if Emacs. Pretty sweet. I know there are many ways to achieve this but it feels very efficient. Org-mode is great. Life in text files but with all the power of an advanced task management system if you want it. I tried org-roam for a while but had to drop it. I wasn't getting a lot of value from it. I might try it again when it is a more mature package.
