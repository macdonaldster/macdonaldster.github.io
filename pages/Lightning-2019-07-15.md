# Lighting

Seems like we get it every night, this summer.

I use an Android app to keep an eye on the storms. It's hard to explain the interface but it shows you where strikes are happening in near real time on a map at whatever scale you'd like. Great for tracking fast moving lightning storms so you know when it's safe to head back outside. 

Take a look at "Blitzortung Lightning Monitor": [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.blitzortung.android.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.blitzortung.android.app)
