# 2019 In Review

- Switched to a paper/agenda calendar, this continues into 2020
- Took steps to deal with my tendency to think negatively, life is much better with a positive attitude
- Travelled to NS, BC, and areas around AB
- Cooked marshmallows over a fire several times but only slept in a tent once
- Stopped craving fast food
- Accepted the fact that driving here sucks and I am choosing not to let it bother me (hell is other people)
