# 2020-11-19

I have been using https://logseq.com lately, not emacs and org-mode. It's basically a free clone of Roam Research but using Github repos as a permanent data store. Very nice. You should try it!

I am looking a ways to use it as a blog engine. Not sure how how but it is possible. If I do that, I'll probably start replacing this blog with pages from logseq.
