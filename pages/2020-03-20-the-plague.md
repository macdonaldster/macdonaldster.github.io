# The Plague - 2020-03-20

Our son's teacher has started to send us classroom stuff through Google Classroom. This will be a big help and is great for morale!

I am finding that the extra time with our family is great but my introverted nature means I am staying up too late to decompress. I need to get more sleep. Working on that in the coming week.

Today, I am looking ahead in my caledar to April and wondering if the MRI and dental appointments I have schedule will happen. And how will this affect the need to get cars in for regular warranty visits if you want to stay compliant with the maintenance schedule. Minor concerns at this point.
