# No Caffeine - Day 1

About a week ago, I started getting really brutal headaches. I think they are mild migraines but I've never been diagnosed with them and so I don't go around saying I get them. My mother has been diagnosed as have other family members, though, so I figure it's a safe bet for me.

When I was younger, I would get splitting headaches every single day and was not really given Aspirin, Tylenol, or Advil for them for whatever reason until one day, when I was in my early teens, my family doctor chewed my mother out and insisted she give me something for my headaches if I told her I needed one. I was, and remain, eternally grateful to that man. It made a huge difference to my quality of life.

Now, and for many years, headaches are pretty rare. Maybe the occasional mild one with a cold or flu, and a few times a year a very severe headache that is brutal on day one and tapers off over a couple days. But this new round of headache has lasted longer than before and is reducing in severity much more slowly. When I get like this only Advil and a ton of water plus some quiet (eyes closed) time get me to a place of relief. But that is only sort of working this time.

So a few days pass and I woke up on Saturday morning feeling headache free. Then I had a coffee and within 30 minutes the headache was back. Hm. So, I decided, I'll quit coffee for a while and see if that helps. I've tapered off coffee using green team many times over the course of my life and have that routine down pat so I tried it starting today. So far so good. I do have a mild headache but nothing like the previous days.

I am hoping to journal here regarding my time caffeine free and just see how it goes. I am interest in seeing how my mood, sleep, energy level, and overall health is affected by this.
