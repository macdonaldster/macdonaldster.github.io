# Random Thoughts

OK, I have a few minutes before I go pick up my son from daycare.

Lately, I don't know why I have a web site. I keep thinking there's a reason.

What have been up to?

- we recently took a trip to Calgary, about 3 hours away, using it as a home base to venture into the mountains and also as a delivery location for delicious Calgary BBQ and fried chicken. It was very, very hot there, though, and so we ended up running for cover to our non-AC'd AirBnB which cut some days short and made sleeping a little gross. I did find it very, very restful and relaxing, though, and our dog got to do some swimming, which is really nice.

- writing - I am working on a new short story where this guy is part of a paramilitary force that protects a city from hordes of infected people who are like zombies. It's a zombie story. He's been told these people are not human anymore, that they can never recover from the infection. But, in reality, they can. Discovering this changes everything for him.
