# Images!

I just found a really nice little extension for VS Code that will dump a pasted image into a folder for you. This should make it much easier to add images to stuff here. It also drops a link to that uploaded file into your Markdown document. Very smooth once I got it configured correctly (it worked out of the box, but I set up some paths for the destination folder and the Markdown text that is pasted into the file once it saves the image you have pasted).

The extension is [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image).

I found it on this page, which I was using to procrastinate from actually writing: [Writing Mode in VS Code - https://diessi.ca/](https://diessi.ca/blog/writing-mode-in-vs-code/)

And, here's an image:
