# Update -- not much to report

I haven't written her for a while. Not because I don't have anything to say or I am tired of blogging. I just haven't felt like anything I am working on is finished enough to write about and I've been limiting the time I spend writing, in general.

To recap the last while:

- made pizza in the charcoal grill, excellent
- put up some privacy panels with garden boxes on the desk, really nice
- started eating Oatmeal for breakfast
- garden is coming along
- I am working on an essay for posting here regarding an economy based solely on reputation as the fungible currency. It's taking a while.
- we are still in lockdown
- I am trying to get more sleep at night so my personal hobbies and tasks are not getting attention, such is life
