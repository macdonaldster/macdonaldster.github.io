# No Caffeine - Day ? (1.5 weeks later, I guess)

So, as it turned out the caffeine was not causing my headaches. I eventually realized a couple things.

1. I should probably wear my glasses while working.
2. I had some kind of sinus issue, took Tylenol Sinus for a couple days and was eventually down to needing it once a day then no headaches. Been fine since.

I am not sure what was going on there, it might have been an allergic reaction, I guess. I really have no idea. The only other symptom I had was some mild nausea from the severity of the headaches, occasionally.

During this time I researched my supplements, tried getting more sleep, and cut out coffee except for a half cup each day after work (3pm). I drank a lot of green tea. I thought that cutting down on coffee would feel better than it did. I felt OK, but not as OK as when I have that delicious cup or two of stimulant each morning.

So to sum up, I am back to drinking coffee, the crazy headaches stopped, and I have a new appreciation for green tea.
