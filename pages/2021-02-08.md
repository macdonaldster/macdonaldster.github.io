# 2021-02-08 Blog

I have moved the site to be self-hosted, away from Github pages. I found trying to add features to the site was cumbersome and it takes a while for the system to refresh when you commit an edit so trying this for a while.

It is using my hardcoded IP so hopefully I can stay on top of that.
