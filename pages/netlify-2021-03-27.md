# Moving to Netlify

I have migrated the site to Netlify... Seems to be working OK so far but the DNS is still migrating and I don't have an SSL cert yet. 

Update - SSL works... I revoked it from previous server and seemed to work.

I was hoping I could migrate blog posts to Dendron but publishing with it is still a mystery so I'll stick with this system for now.
