It's hard to get my face out of the water because my neck is all screwed up so when I do swim, I have to be on my back. The thing is when I am in the pool, the weight is off my joints and it feels really, really good. I am able to relax my back, etc. I spend most of my time doing exercises and stretches in the pool. I'll be going back. Trying for once a week, maybe twice.\n\nTags: #journal",

One way I know I need to do this is I am constantly hungry! Yesterday, all I wanted to do was eat all day. \n\n* I managed to get to sleep without snacking after dinner and didn't eat overnight, last night. Did I wake up every 30 minutes, hungry? Yes. Does this compare to \"real hunger\"? No. Is it completely psychological? Yes. I AM tired, though. That part is real.\n\nTags: #journal",

Great app. Hoping to optimize my sleep.\n* Eating at night - doing better! I am viewing my nighttime eating as an addictive behaviour rather than satisfying hunger. I mean, do I NEED to eat? No. So I should be able to decide not to. If I feel like that power to decide is not available to me, that means I'm addicted. And who wants to be addicted?\n* We have had a run of rain here which is better than intense heat because I've missed two garbage days in a row because of travel, so our garage litteraly smells like hot garbage. \n\nTags: #journal, #sleep",

					"body": "* Yesterday we had a birthday party for my son at a bowling alley. I was in charge of making sure the kids went up in the correct order on my lane (two lanes of four of five kids). My wife took some pictures and some of them were live photos so they have some movement in them.\n\n    There was one photo of me and I look grotesque. Hunched back (from Akylosing Spondylitis), overweight, moving stiffly, ostomy on my abdomen clearly visible for all to see.\n\n    It was a shock. I mean I know I have some health issues but I have had to convince myself I am all good in order to keep on trucking. I don't have time for pity parties. I can't stop and think of what a freak I am. I need to live my life and set a good example for my son. There was a time when I wasn't like this and I hold on to it. \n\n   Meanwhile, I have now seen myself the way others must see me. That look in their eye is pity. Or disgust, I guess. I don't know. What they don't see is a normal person. I am way too far from the middle of the bell curve for that. The question now is what can I do about it?\n\n* Stretching - been neglecting this for MONTHS. It helps with my posture. I am going to do my stretches and some push-ups right after this and before I get back to work. It only takes five minutes. \n\n* Weight loss - sigh - I have been doing IF (going from 10pm until noon the next day, if I can) but I need to extend the window and eat less inside it. I'd like to cut out nighttime snacking altogether meaning I am going from 7pm until noon or something. I am going to do my best. I would also like to maintain it on weekends, although that is very difficult from a social/family view point. I'll see how I do.\n\n* Clothing - what the hell can I do to hide my ostomy. It is blatantly obvious. Losing weight might help. It must gross people out or freak them out. I guess I can wear hoodies all the time, except when it is really, really warm out. \n\n\nTags: #journal",

					"title": "Laundry Pro-Tips",
					"body": "When I do laundry I always follow a couple of set procedures:\n\n1. Socks - when putting away socks, always put unmatched socks on the far right of the sock drawer (or some other consistent location). When you put the next load away, take those unmatched socks out and try to pair them up with any socks from your current load. I think you'll find more than a few match up. If the same sock is unmatched over a couple of loads, throw it out or use it for something (sock puppet!).\n\n2. If doing a couple of loads, make one load mostly \"pants\". It is a lot easier to put away a load of the same type of item and often if you are dividing a load up there'll be a common article of clothing making up 1/3 or 1/2 of the load. Throw all these in together. Quicker put away.\n\n3. Hang shirts on the right every time, and try to take from the left first. Eventually, all the shirts (and jackets, etc) you never wear are on the left. Put things that you need (suits you wear once a year, winter coats, etc) on the far, far left and put a marker between these and you \"working set\" (I use a suit in a suit bag as a border) and then you can donate the clothes that end up on the left after a while (maybe a year).\n\n4. If you struggle to put away laundry, and you have access to laundry in your home, do smaller loads. Just do a load every 3 days or something. Put that away. It takes no time at all to put away 3 days worth of laundry. This gets you into the habit.\n\n\nTags: #protips\n",

My eyes and throat are irritated. Still rather be here than in the thick of it, so I can't complain, I guess.\n\n- [Notion.so](https://notion.so) continues to be a great product. I am looking forward to the phone app getting offline capabilities but not sure if that will happen. I am an old hand at being offline so I guess I can figure out how to print important lists if I will need them (it is pretty rare these days).\n\n- I have been very busy this week outside of work (and at work, but I always have more than enough to do there, thankfully) so I haven't gotten much done on that open source project I've been trying to help with. I did manage to make a new branch last night and start to poke around at the bug I am trying to fix, I think I figured out the relevant line of code I was hunting for so I'll try to get more done tonight after everyone goes to bed.\n\nTags: #journal, #sleep",

					"title": "Trying out Notion.so",
					"body": "Lately, I have been trying out [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as a way to track TODO items. I always tell people I like either using a spreadsheet or a plain text file for this (or the equivalent in paper form, etc). Notion feels like that. \n   \nA text page in Notion is like a text file. Free form, write what you like. A \"database\" in Notion is like a spreadsheet. And you can embed linked tables all over the place that go back to the database. \n\nSo here's how I am using it. I can have a \"Project page\" where I keep resources and notes on a project and embed my master TODO list but filter it down to display just the project TODOs. Every time I try a new \"app\" or \"system\" there's always some limitation imposed by the system which makes it hard to organize appropriately for the way I think about tasks. Notion seems to solve that problem.\n\nAre there drawbacks? Sure. No working offline is a MAJOR drawback. But one I'll live with for a while. I can always fall back to email to draft notes and lists when offline (e.g. flying). If I want some data I might need (e.g. while camping, I guess?) I can dump it into another format (e.g. markdown files) as you can export the pages. \n\nIt is also \"slow for capture\" which is a problem I have learned to get around after trying so many systems. What I do is use IFTTT when I need to quickly capture something. I have an IFTTT note widget that sends an email to me with the address macdonaldster+TODO@g.... This gets auto-tagged as \"TODO\". I frequently clear these into whatever system I am using to organize. In this case by adding them to the master task list in Notion.\n\nTags: #productivity",

					"body": "I am on my lunch break and have about five minutes left before I go back to work. I thought I would take a moment to talk about TODO list. \n\nThis is a reaction to Seraphim's \"if the list has rules, I won't do it\" comment. I see this a lot. Certain people don't like rules. Well, I like rules but I really, really understand why people feel this way about \"productivity systems\". The more rules, the less time you will follow it. Your natural state takes over at some point. See comments here: http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2019/3/5/lenten-challenge-startsstarted-at-midnight-your-local-time.html\n\nI don't know where Mark Forster said this but I do know I read this sentiment on his site and I agree with it: you are almost always better off doing any task than you are checking the list for a task to do. What I mean is if something is right in front of you and you are feeling like you really could do it, just go for it. This is the opposite of \"rules for the list\".\n\nI go to the list when for the following reasons:\n\n1. review - ensure I am not missing anything, I do this when I am not feeling productive, it is a task I do when procrastinating or when I am feeling like too much time has passed since my last review so I feel out of control (this can be five minutes, five days, or five weeks depending on what is happening).\n\n2. focus list - a special case of review, sometimes I know I have a day to get house stuff done and there are a few items on my main list that are about the house so I run through it ignoring everything that isn't \"house\" and make a focus list to churn through that day.\n\n3. task details - I know I need to call Bob and wrote his number down with the task.\n\nIn none of these cases am I stopping what I am doing to \"go back to the list\". It is either a process task (review or focus list) or a reference for a task I decided to do (details). If you are the type of person who forgets critical tasks maybe you need a daily focus list or a calendar entry to get a certain task done (tasks on a calendar that are not appointments are a sort of focus list). \n\nThis means the list isn't dictating your next moves, you are. \n\nTags: #productivity",

I attributed a wide set of actions happening at many levels by many people to \"Trump\" as if he has masterminded this plan to tear down the FBI so that everyone who was in top positions there that was investigating him has been removed from their job under a cloud. This was done on purpose. It is sending a message: investigate the Trump Administration and you're gone. But it isn't like Trump is sitting there with an Excel spreadsheet late at night modelling different approaches and considering outcomes. \n\n    Here's what probably happened: some evil guy was saying \"you know what you need to do, you need to fire each and every one of them\" and Trump was thinking \"I should, I should fire them all for investigating me\" and then the evil guy actually started the ball rolling, and then other evil guys got involved, and the all worked together - calling good people out in the press, creating crazy consipiracies for Fox News to explain why people were getting fired, punatively and publically firing people just before then pension for a lifetime of service kicked in, etc. \n\n    None of this was Trump. It was done under his authority and with his blessing but probably had no actual specific direction by him. He's just there, screaming on Twitter, while others are taking care of business and probably helping themselves to some benefits along the way (sowing the seeds of dissent in the institutions that maintain the rule of law, you know).\n\n\n\nTags: #journal",

But then I asked myself why I even care? What does it matter? Should I stop writing because no one comes? Does writing public entries change what I am writing in a way that is useful to me? Should I redirect the time I spend writing here onto writing stories or memoirs? Should I write AT ALL?\n\nHere's the thing: I like writing. It does something good to my brain. It relaxes me to get thoughts like this out. It focuses my mind. And I know that no one will ever read this but knowing someone might is enough to subtly shape what and how I write. And that is useful, it has an organizing effect on my thinking.\n\nFor now, I'll keep at it, but I have to wonder if maybe I should be redirecting my $5 USD a month to keep this running into a YouTube Premium subscription or something.\n",

It's that feeling you get when Christmas is coming and you haven't done your shopping yet. That's how I feel all the time. I wish meditation helped with this. I mean, it sort of does. I think meditation helps me to understand the difference between feeling this way and acting from the feeling. When I feel this way, I really just need to prioritize and act. Action takes away the feeling that I am not doing enough. Work the list. Deal with interruptions. Stay calm. Don't project onto other people. Try to get enough sleep. Eat well. Repeat. \n\n* I cooked a nice meal tonight. It was pot roast with various mushrooms braised in the cooking liquid of the beef then fried in garlic butter. Served with a quick pickle of carrots and cucumber with a little sesame oil in it, roasted cauliflower with Asiago cheese, and some roasted sweet potato. It was pretty good. I think a lot of people would feel very, very fortunate to have had that meal for dinner and I do, too. \n\n* In US news - William Barr, you lying sack of shit (to paraphrase Johnny Mnemonic calling Ralfi, after being ambushed). I would be way more OK with Republicans if they just owned it. If they would just say \"F--k you guys, we're lying to your face and there's nothing you can do about it, in fact, here's the deal: Trump is a criminal but he's in charge and we're getting what we want, so f--k you.\" I would have so much more respect for them (which is to say, slightly more than no respect at all) if they were honest in this way. Instead, they insist on treating us all like idiots. Admittedly, a lot of their voters are complete idiots. But the ones that aren't are going along with them, they are in on the joke, and it makes them feel superior. That is really sad. Think about it for a minute. You are going to lie to someone's face when they know you are lying, but it props you up because it makes you feel powerful. You know they can't do anything about your lying, other than call you out on it, and you deal with that with more lying. And that is the political strategy of the Republicans. Boggles the mind. \n\nTags: #journal",

I take everything out and match containers to lids. Orphan lids and containers get recycled. Then I set aside the best containers including specialized ones I use regularly. Everything else goes into a recycling bag and stored in the basement. If we want to get in there and get back a container we cannot live without, the bag is there. If we find the bag 6 months from now and it hasn't been opened, it can get recycled without further treatment.\n\n* My office got a nice upgrade. Turns out we are getting a new rug for the living room so the old one is now in my office, replacing a combination of door mats and castaways that I had been using (they would always move out of place or bunch up). My floor is much more comfortable for stretching and sitting to meditate. The dog loves it. \n\n* I also boxed up our cable boxes and remotes for return back to the service provider. We've been cable free since the end of the week and having no issues finding \"something to watch\" (which, excluding children's programming) we do for about an hour a day. Saving $100/month.

					"body": "**TL/DR**: the real secret to The Hacker's Diet is Walker was doing One Meal A Day (OMAD) before it was cool. This form of intermittent fasting is really, really good for steady weight loss.\n\nThe year was 1999, or something. I was struggling to understand weight loss and had been having trouble with simply \"eating less\" and losing weight. I had the Internet. I don't know how, but at some point I stumbled across [The Hacker's Diet](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/) by [John Walker, \"founder of Autodesk, Inc. and co-author of AutoCAD\"](https://www.fourmilab.ch/).\n\nI read through Walker's guide to tracking your weight and calories and adjusting the calories in such a way as to maintain a 10% weighted average weight loss over time. [Weighing every day](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/weightmonitor.html), [tracking calories](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/planningmeals.html), and following his [fitness ladder](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html). \n\nHere's the thing - this REALLY worked and worked well. All I needed was discipline and some tracking in a spreadsheet. I stuck with it for 1.5 years and lost 65lbs. This was a pretty big achievement for me at the time but it was very challenging and I was very obsessive about it all. I was going to university, had very little social life, and just stuck to my guns. I weighed my food, I skipped rope for 20 minutes a night, and I didn't drink beer (2 light beers on Saturday night). I lost weight steadily but more and more slowly as time went on, despite trying harder and harder.\n\nSomething happened, long story, and I stopped caring about my weight and went back to regular beers, pizza, and whatever else I felt like. I stopped all the intense cardio. I gained the weight back in about three months.\n\nFast forward several years later and I learn about the Ketogenic Diet. I noticed that the same thing happens: it works really well for a while then you get diminishing returns. And what do Keto people do when they stop seeing rapid results? They fast. Many of them go to an intermittent fasting routine with a fairly long gap between meals (e.g. only eating for 8 hours in every 24). Some of them go to one meal a day (OMAD). \n\nToday, while sitting around with some friends while our children played, I was drinking beer and eating pizza again and thinking I should get back on my keto regime soon. For a while I've been trying to skip breakfast and this has been working well for me and is surprisingly easy. Out of the blue, I remembered The Hacker's Diet, and then I remembered a throw away tidbit from that venerable document. \n\n\u003e For various reasons dating back to the lifestyle of programmers in the bronze age of computing, I have long preferred one of the weirdest meal schedules of all. I eat basically one meal a day, about 7 or 8 hours after I awake. I supplement this, on occasion, with a light snack a few hours later. \n\n-- How many meals, and when? in [Planning Meals](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/planningmeals.html)\n\nYes, Walker eats one meal a day. Wow. This was a throw away line in his document to illustrate how it doesn't matter when you eat, just that you controlled your calories per day somehow. His strange eating schedule is an example of how you can eat less by eating fewer meals. \n\n**This is the real secret of The Hacker's Diet!** \n\nAnd it is the real secret of Keto. Once you get to the point where you are plateauing with any diet, your only answer is to eat less. And the easiest way to do this is to not eat for a long time. If you try to just have smaller meals (or, worse, more very small meals) you will be riding that wave of hunger/satiation over and over which leads to many more chances to overeat each day. It is far better to settle into hunger. As soon as your body figures out it isn't getting a meal until later, it fades away a little (talking about people who have access to food, this is not really hunger, it is more appetite and we are incredibly privileged to be able to feel appetite and not true hunger).\n\nTags: #keto",

This really sucks because money. We haven't put much into the car for a very long time so I guess we should have expected a big repair. \n* I have a few goals for this month:   \n    1. Complete the clearing out of a box of files I've been working through (keep/shred)\n   2. Get back into regular push-ups (had a bunch of chest inflammation from AS and couldn't do these for a while, I think strengthening the chest and core will help, and they are good for my \"back\", plus I am out of shape) - so far this is going well!\n  3. Begin daily meditation again - hit and miss on this. I have formally sat several times but also steal moments here and there to focus on my breathing and try to get into something like a zazen state - this is useful even for a minute or so at a time. \n  4. I have also been trying to get back into a daily stretching routine but this has not come as easily. If I can just get the push-ups back as a habit I will be happy, the stretching is a bonus.\n\nTags: #journal",

					"body": "Got back from another trip to BC. We spent several days on Vancouver Island around Victoria and Sooke, BC then a night in Parksville, BC, finishing our trip in Abbotsford, BC because our flight left from there.\n\nThat province is incredibly lush and beautiful, especially compared to Edmonton at this time of year. \n\nThe bulk of our stay was in an AirBNB that had a bunch of goats living on the property. Our son loved it. He never tired of talking to the goats and feeding them. We hiked in Port Renfrew and around the Sooke area as well as tons of beach visits. We spent time in urban areas as well. We mostly cooked at home but had a few great meals. Nature bathing was the theme of this trip.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FAxt7wS8Mxb4OcxPhXJwfkAFAvh9ewTnTJ1iEshCcVPLlzyJ5f0pFtXVyDywGIEOy8zJNvTYDw1tJ0q9TrhP-Th0MZ8RBe3rO8nY83MVCtn4pfNvf2SnIfKVXNMjmRzVj-EZkUgJW9JLoPHljIWl2Hkv2zwK_Uw3qFuhbC5hHB7kBIK8og8lrq0FziZ3qtGJHU0CiVbOY-aPcGvcDiV72Ukt9VIj5jfxakuRHuA3tBzFpiOWkuFfxEb0Yx-2KkdhaDn-URXBsg9utyc3-IgiwRvOeNd6rmR835f3tpqfWtxyU0pzRVkmQUk7BnI9XKkF-Cac0ZNRN63mYq7-UQu2zQsxZpD3bV0QdP5GFBtmVE2iY0qoXh1f6ohG1TKXH2tolwzY7NLGTF0QrY4jsJ-iVX6bJa4NmA_s2EzesVUuuMZlHhvOOewIFqoaJJgEt73TgKyqXcSm5uQVzGOq9e4zvZPsoEkL1KHUeRsxm77zU8oiEWfO7kLjG-sBCr7lBUt4IHJzS4Q5raBbfrFS2WSU49HY03W88n-MEUhnmKwYCmicjLhL8b4MhvUpXbjMMIOBlLqmuP1yTqJMF5cO6qzTEL0E99CCWnT_BugADhgath3VeJMpuwPuREBsgEdYq1eCZ48_bB5iitDXg7O_QgIKEIheyHH7UBk=w1263-h947-no)\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yRlKvmGD_n9yCXiqZuKLgkIoXx5OnpV7tLYgnrlbPwRMjIoWPvnJudSnY9QvrDrNfVCn17GsO-ZemKMkotnnvmHclW0vDMRGV7j5KjlPCTDAGXB4wuWC16ABQoVK_XthOSGmI5D3FwnSNhNbC4ZbrjCOHw0kzjHnxqEKkig2cHiRL3OGupRKoiaSys2RYX4KsHpb85JBcvVh8_S2jfBa2MzA3NLk9mDzom_-fIE8aIG6MYFj7VUoyM15YCU_bgc6DAy77HP9o9Th3o3uLMbjm8J-Fn0lhJXt53DCNb4e_ZiSR7uBSo5BfwQU-DqGHKLe-I-b67eZUyBhktnuJmCwINlQdKHp9eSEaX0lSeEOq6RKTVuz_Qtzp0pm_PMJsRFsnUqyrbW3kzoyIyYj3WNi4hzl73LLuiOvo3NAmxfDefBCOiiK9UqCHBFEzywf0g8AFJEJwKO51AaXbdSfjs6vTOFsfJZiMnSGPPVAELxBl3u5ojCTzxonA_79EGuKfeSl_lxqxQH91wP1oRs82TXmcyc2-1kU_8kwPVUarvFWAQevOtO8RmGh6vgf32WW1EYHVthiwxKgzgwRIoHivcVFBKeRuxV3rqK8ejLEVyy_rrHiBZfmwsxbut5TXrjmtGZTGLnIX1QFhWit1nXwBZAI_QYfWCmZU5o=w1263-h947-no)\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ux5OHo8qDfpps6KS7CjBN_YmB9b97LUGsHPR8YOtzPs0Vwk2_H2ykkMXtrEXGYVtG2ks1z9h1yNrlFPP_IwJHiDxRWUSDYjyTO6Bct95zV6wvsKGevwa2j_9e0rVR77Kuui_EVTKDx95Z7DWVhX_9CCMgaJD8i6Ln5Q1iIS8VxnMvABCsEaMV0nvNRcMuscSEN5YiNHgRwooMp6Ccu2k0CgUXlPNKdWjkzPauBdCnFnOswlw0Hqv9JXdc54tvj4vb2OdHzIpuysdCyI0AnJ4Yn2qjXnhvWIZ-fyztDFEMlznOrsK-74iPmuDOTYCWBx_3fq_HTwOLGFDTvMjlGFxu-IJOhj1VX3TJU2rgBj07XyJce0S_yP4Hw3IkcVOsbBGhpIAwy7_wXNJavYPZiGA2U1OYiQUw_9PiKOE1OEU1SqfkfzuPbkdsH0SC5yGqXTUjJp4n711U75HbBDbGUPvfTmP2N7gGn007OhYn2I3kqWxFuyaq-_CR4xCZzJXlke6L4LG1L66QzZJzYu9Tw8_lgjYUsRD7DA6xT4-LMrENag31ct9qt8Hflheb4n0aAmsP9CSrY4xnbrfF4Sje_qG4-Q9fMhid2-SSD6NWl4QkI50McX4c6wmTJzddq0OQ2S_mtjRXCa1chmsad5tuKgwfv1UNVTinb8=w1920-h934-no)\n\nTags: #journal",

					"title": "Universal Basic Income (UBI)",
					"body": "The problem with UBI has nothing to do with people being lazy and getting by on their $1,000/month \"freedom dividend\". The real problems are:\n\n1. **The market will price up basic goods to \"soak up\" that extra money being dumped into the economy.** This is because very little of this money will go into savings. It will mostly get spent. And spending means demand for basic goods increases. This drives up prices. Now, the hope is that the price goes up a little but the satisfaction of basic needs goes up a lot. Kids get more nutritious food, adults get more job training, you can take some time off instead of working overtime, and so forth. \n\n2. **Gig economy, especially, but businesses in general will drive down wages or provide fewer benefits.** The UBI stipend will mean people can take lower paying jobs. The hope is that this means people will do things like work part time and go back to school, or maybe will be able to work less and spend more time caring for an aging relative. The reality is in any job that can get away with it the price of labor will drop to account for the fact that the people that take those jobs need less to squeak by because they have UBI. \n\nThe hedge against the second point (which could provide enough money to overcome the first point) is to mandate a minimum wage that is sufficient to provide a full time employee with enough income to put a roof over their head (maybe this is a shared apartment in a bad part of town, just any roof) and food in their belly.\n\n## Commentary\n\nThere is something you always need to remember when you are thinking about scenarios like UBI: \"There is no such thing as a free lunch.\"\n\nThere's a reason that no matter how hard you work, you can't get ahead. It's called the market. The reason, in Canada, our lives don't totally suck is because we are not 100% free market driven. Healthcare, for example, is NOT a free market. It is regulated, and we all benefit. Some things do not do well in a free market because markets tend to drive toward solutions that are not necessarily optimizing utility. They will happily trade this for profit. \n\nDoes this mean I hate Capitalism? Do I view free markets as a horrible thing that we must eliminate? No, not at all. But it is important to remember that things are not as simple as either/or solutions. The world is complex, there are no simple solutions to the problems we face. We must use our wisdom and experience to work out the best solutions and tune them over time. Saying \"the market can solve any problem\" is a typical example of overly simplistic thinking. This is a total abdication of responsibility. If two children you are looking after have a conflict do you say \"hey, kids, the market will solve this... which one of you has more money on you?\". No, you try to get into the problem and work out a compromise. And you try to get them to be nice to each other and the empathize. \n\nThink about what the world would be like if we never took the time to come up with complex solutions. \n\nContagious diseases? Let's let everyone who gets one die off and then the people left will be immune. Simple, right? What do you get? Anti-vaxxers (all too real). \n\nDon't need cops if everyone has a gun? Try living between a couple of warring drug cartels... will you buy a gun and jump in there, try to get away, or wait to get caught in the crossfire? Hm, maybe life is better with law and order, and not \"might makes right\".\n\nWhy bother cultivating crops, I can just hunt and gather! And so on... \n\nHistory is basically the journey of humans from a living in a state of hard scrabble survival to a state of plenty (and relative peace) as a result of pursuing more and more complex and interwoven solutions. So when I hear people proposing we turn the clock back (conservatives) by deregulating, reducing social programs, ignoring science, and hating \"the other\" I just can't stand it. Grow up people, that way leads back to the stone age.\n\nTags: #opinion",

					"title": "My TODO List",
					"body": "## Latest as of 2019-04-08\n\nSo since I wrote my initial explanation of the todo list system I'm using I've ended up putting the list into a Google Sheet. I kept pasting my txt file into sheets (one line per entry makes this simple) to do little things like \"what are my grocery items\" because I got tired of dealing with syncing the text file and adding to the PHP script to do various filtering, etc.\n\nI am now implementing the system, below, using a Google Sheet. The various lists I want to consult are just \"query()\" function call on separate worksheets pulling entries from the main list. The query function also strips out the tags so when looking at groceries, every line item doesn't have \"#groceries\" on it. I also have an ad hoc query so I can enter a tag and it pulls them out. Custom formatting crosses out lines when prefixed with an X. \n\nIf I ever want to go back to text files, I can just copy/paste the lines from the main sheet. It is that simple. \n\n## As of 2019-02-07\n\nI wanted to write about how I am currently doing “TODO List” right now because I change “my system” all the time. I don't have a system. I capture, review, and act. How I capture determines where I do reviews.\n\nI have used apps, spreadsheets, paper lists and journals, Google Tasks, and everything in between. Special shouout to just using a stack of index cards. They are all fine. None of them will help you get anything more done than you want to do.\n\nHaving said that, here is how I am doing my thing as of today (for about a month now):\n\nText file called “todo.txt”.\n\n- stored on my vps\n- synched to my Android with Syncthing\n- displayed on the web with some very basic PHP (more, below)\n- Each line is a TODO\n- Completed get “x ” at start of line\n- The first date (e.g. 2019-02-08) is a “due date” of sorts (first, upcoming date)\n- Any #tag is a tag on the project line (good for filter and sort)\n- Capture – add a line to todo.txt. I have an IFTTT that calls a PHP script that adds on the file or I can just edit the text file on the VPS or Android. The format is very similar to TODO.txt (https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt).\n\nReview – start at the top and go to the end. “x ” off what is completed. If I act on something I “x” it off and move it to the end if it isn't completed (a copy). This is basically the Simple Scanning method or Long List method by Mark Forster with my own spin.\n\nActing – I actually try and “do” without reviewing the list. The list is a backup for my memory. I found with fiddly apps (e.g. Emacs org-mode) I was spending all my time “improving my system” or “moving things out my inbox”. Screw all that, it is a waste of time for me and just has the effect of squirreling away TODO items where I cannot see them (not great if you have a bad memory). Sure, the org-mode agenda will surface them. Then I can defer them! So helpful. :)\n\nProjects and reference materials – I have folders in Google Drive (Sheets, scans, etc) and VPS (text files) where I have project documentation. These are not TODO list extensions. They are project plans and resources. I take notes there, log data there, etc.\n\nOn the go – I have a PHP web application that slices and dices my todo.txt file and displays it. This is a read-only view and allows me to focus in on one aspect of the list but I can't fiddle with it unless I edit the PHP code which is a separate activity and something I avoid doing! The views I have are:\n\nThe entire list including completed items\n- Grocery list (actually a file called “grocery.txt”) – I have another IFTTT that appends to this from my phone.\n- Upcoming – tasks with dates, sorted by date, ascending\n- Tags – each tag with the list of tasks below it (tasks in more than one tag will appear more than once)\n- TODO ASAP – I have a special tag #! that means “do ASAP” and this is just that list. This is what I keep in front of me.\n\nThat's pretty much how it works now.\n\nTags: #todo, #productivity, #plaintext",

					"title": "Trump Supporters",
					"body": "I've been wanting to write for a while on the topic \"How I see Trump Supporters\". My opinion on this has been formed primarily by spending time on a subreddit where people ask Trump Supporters to explain how they feel about various Trump related things but I've also just been paying attention generally to various other sources of information. While I might attempt to provide some numbers or other research to back up the claims here, this should be regarded as my own opinion. I am not claiming I am completely correct and my opinions tend to change over time as I learn new things.\n\nOne thing I think anyone could agree on is that there is a real mish mash of people claiming to be supporters. Some of them are certainly not \"real people\" (bots/trolls, etc), a good number of them are not even American (neither am I), and they are not monolithic in their views. On Reddit, Twitter, and other social media you can never really tell who you are interacting with. Many Trump supporters on these sites are trolling and are not representative of the average citizen, many are too young to really have the kind of life experience that leads you to take a person's political views seriously, and some are clearly nuts. \n\nIt is easy enough to find this same sort of thing but on the left side of the political spectrum. Let's say you have to learn to net off that type of opinion and look for the serious types. In addition to Reddit I have read interviews with supporters, watched them speak on video, paid attention to other subreddits, other right wing media sources, and talked to people who support him in person. There are also lots of people on the left trying to figure supporters out and I have read and listened to their opinions as well.\n\nAnd, before we jump in, I want to be clear: I think plenty of people support Trump without this making them a terrible person. They typically don't know, or have taken time to think through, how far this could go toward making peoples lives terrible. There a lots of people who simply don't really analyze their political opinions critically and think their support has little or no effect on the political process. They may not think the political process has a real effect on other people's lives, either. These are people who do not fully participate other than voting (at most) and think of politics as a side show. For them, Trump is finally sticking it to the man or telling it like it is or is just funny. It would be like if Rodney Dangerfield's Caddyshack character became president and stuck it to all the stuffed shirts. Hilarious. Unfortunately, there are real world impacts. \n\nAs I will discuss in more detail, below, I think the vast majority of Trump supporters are normal people who just have no idea how things work and who will not take the time to really understand the underlying issues (or simply cannot for whatever reason). For these people, ignorance is bliss and Trump is a politician that it feels good to support. They see in him everything they want to see and wave away any feelings that he isn't what they want. These are the people who must be convinced that Trump doesn't care about them, at all. Not that he is immoral, unethical, rude, stupid - they don't care about any of this... they only care that he's got their back. Show he doesn't and they will stop voting for him. Maybe. It is hard to say because the same people that support him are often the least informed, even about their favorite politician.\n\nYou would need to do more than have an audio tape or quote of him saying things like \"my supporters are idiots\". It would need to be a video of him, sitting in quiet reflection, unaware he was being recorded, with other people in frame who would be willing to verify the video. It would help if it were more than one media source recording it. Perhaps best would be a conversation on stage where he thought the mics were off but they hot, and he went on a monologue about how pathetic the people at his rallies were and how he was just using them for this or that. I still don't think that would be enough, though. \n\n## The categories of supporters (not exhaustive)\n\n- Wealthy, just cares about money \n- White Supremacist/American Nationalist (not the same but not all that different in their reasons for support)\n- Irrational and/or \"strict father\" voter\n\n## The degrees of support (all of these groups might attend rallies, donate, and vote):\n\n- The People (vote R) - barely aware of connection between politics and real life, thinks it is a reality show\n- The Base - interested in politics but not well informed, thinks it is a team sport (vote R)\n- The Vocal - really into supporting Trump - social media, public support, Trump is an infallible god-like figure\n\n## What motivates support\n\nThe fact is Trump lies. He lies all the time. He contradicts himself. He says things that will get him a laugh or applause. You can always find a Trump word salad to support your idea of what he will do for you (usually with almost mind boggling assumptions that are easily proven false a lot of the time). You can also almost always find Trump contradicting himself (e.g. [Trump Criticizes Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/)). \n\nSo people support him for their own reasons. Often the reasons don't even make sense. \"He's going to fix healthcare\" while he tries to tear it down. \"He's reducing the deficit\" while he... you get the picture. It's exhausting to try to understand what these people are thinking when they say these things.\n\n### The Wealthy (not all of them, just the Trump Supporters)\n\nThese people do not care about anything as much as protecting their investments. They may be philanthropic but want to control every aspect of that, rather than handing money to the government. There is a lot of overlap in this category with people in the other two categories but they would still support a candidate that made the rich richer over any other candidate regardless of ideology.  \n\nWealthy supporters are often lukewarm. Their support will only grow because of the giant tax cut, the desire to see regulation stripped away, and the destruction of health care which will lead to their investments growing. But they acknowledge he is a boor and a useful idiot. Ultimately, this is short sighted for their nation but these people do not care because they can move their money elsewhere if they need to. This also covers off politicians like Lindsey Graham who are only associated with Trump for the access to power (e.g. staying in office, passing bills that benefit their sources of campaign contributions). These people often happen to also be wealthy.\n\n### White Supremacist / American Nationalist\n\nThis is everyone from \"they terk my jerbs\" to \"Hitler wasn't so bad\". These people have always been lying in wait, but now one of their own is in the White House and, increasingly, in Governor's mansions in various red states. This has emboldened them and they are fully behind Trump regardless of anything he might do on any other front. He is basically the closest thing they will ever get to real representation in their lifetimes (I hope). I won't go into this too much as I think it is painfully obvious this is happening and their star is rising a little with Trump. They good news is a competent and moral administration can easily drive them back underground with policing.\n\n### Irrational and/or \"Strict Father\" supporters \n\nI will lump religious/evangelical right wing voters in here... You get a lot of different groups in this category:\n\n  - QAnon types\n  - Anti-abortion \"single issue\" voters\n  - \"Originalists\"\n  - \"Anti-vaxxers\"\n  - 2nd amendment extremists - these are people for whom the NRA is a big deal\n  - more or less mentally ill people who see conspiracies everywhere and blame them for their problems (some overlap here with white supremacists)\n  - And, finally, a group of people who are politically unsophisticated enough to think a guy like Trump can \"come in and fix it all\"... these people are more \"strict father\" than irrational and just happen to have a really inaccurate mental model of how things work at literally any level of government (and probably any organization).\n\nThese people are really the real base of support. They are the most numerous. George Carlin always told a joke about how the average IQ is 100 and there's lots of people on either side of that average. There are many, many people with very low intelligence intellectually and/or emotionally. They really cannot understand how much voting Republican goes against their own self-interest. As discussed above, they probably don't even think it is related. These people live in a constant swirl of logical fallacies and contradictions. They \"don't believe in Science\", they failed their driving test because \"the DMV guy hated them\", they think news is stupid, and so on. For them, Trump just changed from the \"You're Fired\" show to the \"West Wing\" show. They revel in his constant bragging and how easily all the nerds get upset by his antics.\n\nFor them, competence is something to be suspicious of. They see in Trump what they would be if they were given the job. Don't assume this is some fringe group... this is a large percentage of the electorate, far greater than 10%. They possibly make the majority of that block of voters that simply will never turn on Trump. Again, I want to point out this is only my opinion and I cannot back this up with research.\n\nHow does Strict Father play into this? It is pretty simple, really. They think \"What Trump does is right, what he says is true.\" \n\nThis is so much easier than trying to think things through or do your own analysis. And if some tool who isn't part of your family criticizes your strict father Trump, you let him have it. He doesn't get to tell you what to think! That is Trump's job. And he's the President! So who are you to try to say he's wrong. You get the picture. Strict Father also explains the evangelical support. Trump pretends to care about abortion. He obviously doesn't like non-Christian religions. They see him as protecting them and they like to be protected, to stay insulated (opposed to illegal immigration), and to be given easy answers they can hold onto.\n \n\n## Behaviour patterns when defending support\n\nI want to get into this more but it will need to wait for another day. I'll publish this now and add to it when I can. \n\n- move goal posts\n- compare to an imaginary opponent \"both sides do it\"\n- declare \"it doesn't matter\"\n- connect dots that are not related, deep state, etc. \n\n## Links that illustrate my points\n\nThese are basically anecdotal but here are links where you can see people discussing their support for Trump (or discussion Trump Supporters) that offer some support for what I have written above:\n\n- /r/AskTrumpSupporters threads: \n\n    - [What does supporting Trump mean to you?

					"body": "I was woken up this morning by my garage door opening. This is not normal because it was 4AM and anyone who should be doing that was asleep in the same room as me. The room is right over the garage. I immeadiately went to check on things, assuming a neighbour's opener had set ours off. \n\nWhen I looked out our bedroom window there was no one around and my car was in the driveway, where I left it, with the doors shut. I went down to the garage immeadiately and the door was open. I closed it and checked the house. I had mopped the floor the night before, and our floor shows every little scuff so I was sure no one had come into the house unless they had taken their shoes off first but I checked the place out. \n\nNormally, when someone breaks into a car, they leave the doors open so shutting them doesn't wake anyone up. I guess I left it unlocked but I NEVER leave my car unlocked. I must have, this time, because they went through the car and got the garage door opener from it (took some stuff that looked like a wallet but was just some random crap I carry with me in the car that was in a bag on the front seat). \n\nThey probably took off when the light came on in the garage. There was booze by the door into the house. If they made it that far the would have grabbed some or all of the booze, for sure.\n\nAnyway, the cops were here and took a statement, etc. No harm done but it makes me want a baseball bat or something for when I'm checking that sort of thing out. \n\nEdit - 2019-04-02 - Last night came and went with no issues. We are leaving the outside lights on, both vehicles are in the garage, and I will be carrying a bag from now on so it is easier to get all my crap in and out of the house. I feel like the wallet I lost in the car had nothing critical in it (loyalty cards for stores, really) and I found our spare key so it wasn't in the wallet. I did lose a pair of awesome leather gloves which is really irritating to me because they are hard to find (for me, anyway). ",

Policies against making public any info about unindicted subjects will shield Trump and his family from direct implication and this is just intended to appease him and his base. The rest of the world will know what happened and the real story will slowly emerge but this summary, \"no collusion\", will be what people remember and is all Trump's supporters will ever hear about. \n\n**EDIT 2019-03-26** - [Rod Rosenstein Didn’t Even Clear Trump on All the Topics He Hired Mueller to Investigate](https://www.emptywheel.net/2019/03/25/rod-rosenstein-didnt-even-clear-trump-on-all-the-topics-he-hired-mueller-to-investigate/) - In this interesting analysis Marcy Wheeler explains that Barr's summary side-stepped one of the three objectives of the investigation...

As the steaming trays of silverware emerged from the commercial washer we would polish them with napkins and load them into silverware bins for use by the floor staff. It was important they be clean and not covered in fingerprints. I want this at home too! \n\nI have always loaded my home silverware in with the business end of everything but steak knives pointing up. And sometimes I was finding no matter how clean my hands were I was still covering the silverware with my fingerprints when I unloaded it. Sometimes, too, it wasn't quite clean. \n\nRecently, I changed things up and loaded the silverware pointing \"down\". It seems to come out cleaner - possibly because the water is cascading down the utensil somehow getting more water on the bottom of it. And they are easier to unload without touching the parts that people put in their mouths. Win win. \n\nConsidering I've been loading dishwashers for almost 40 years this came as a surprise. Why hadn't it occurred to me before? Why has this not become the only way you would ever load a dishwasher?\n\nTags: #minutiae\n",

					"body": "We own a 2010 Ford Edge and the air quality was terrible. Having recently learned about Cabin Air Filters I picked one up on Amazon.ca (POTAUTO MAP 1041C Heavy Activated Carbon Car Cabin Air Filter Replacement compatible with FORD, Edge, LINCOLN, MKX, MAZDA, CX-9  (Upgraded with Active Carbon) - https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01C5H0AXW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8\u0026psc=1) and watched some YouTube videos about replacing it.\n\n![](/postimages/20190324_cabinairfilter_2010fordedge.jpg)\n\nAs you can see from the above before and after, this was a serious problem that was pretty easy to fix. The dealer charges about $100 for this but you can do it yourself for about $15 CDN if you aren't including shipping, etc. \n\nThere were a few tricks I wanted to note:\n\n-  there is this cable on the glove box preventing the drawer from falling out when open... use a flashlight to inspect how it is attached, it is designed to be removed so don't break it taking it out. Also, it is often AN ELASTIC so it will snap up into the area behind the dash and be hard to find, keep an eye on it and release the tension very slowly... when replacing it, you can probably hook it onto the top of the box while placing the hinges in place, otherwise you'll need a helper or do the hinge part one handed.\n\n- I broke the retaining clip by not seating the filter cover properly and then trying to remove it... this put the filter clip into an impossible position and I broke it by forcing (gently) out. The clip was still attached by one connection, though, and seems to work ok. The filter cover should be held in place simply by friction fit but I'll throw some duct tape on there if it comes out, I guess. \n\nWhen I got it all back together I started up the car with the windows rolled up and was greeted by fresh air, not the mold scented pollution I've been breathing all Winter. I should have done this a long time ago. Also, it has really stepped up the airflow.\n\nTags: #minutiae ",

I don't get enough sleep so I can't afford to lose the little time I do have for sleeping to insomnia. I think this is because a large project I was working on at my job has shipped and seems to be working well.\n\n* Spring has more or less come to the frozen wasteland we call home. Temperatures are above zero during the day for the entire week coming up. Snow is melting. Our seeds have sprouted (INSIDE) and the driveway is clearing itself of the crust of ice that builds up as we get sick of shoveling.\n\n* Keto - I have been less strict with \"Keto\", lately, and find myself stable at a weight about 5lbs over my goal weight for April 1. This means I lost 10lbs since Jan 1st. I am hoping that additional exercise and trying to be more strict about Keto for the final couple of weeks will help but I am OK with where I am at. As long as I lose more than I gain each year, I am at least fighting the tendancy to slowly gain weight as I age. This will help me and I get a little more self-control every year when it comes to food.\n\n* Productivity has kind of stalled in terms of my personal projects but I am still able to pick them up because I've been working my list of tasks slowly but surely.  My biggest TODOs to knock off this month are to complete my son's school registration and to get my taxes filed. I have a bunch of other goals but those are the only two that really matter to anyone but me. The school reg just needs to be dropped off now and the taxes are waiting on documents so things are looking up. \n\n* Do I have any insights here for this blog post? A reason to read? No, not really. But this week two people in my life have had very difficult health crises. Both seem to be OK right now but it makes me think I am lucky to have not had more issues like this by now and I am glad they both got treatment when they needed it.

I have tried to sleep before the 10:30 bathroom trip but that seems to make it less likely I'll get right back to sleep after it. I am considering moving the trip to 10pm. \n\nAt some point, he won't need me to do this. At some point, his brain will wake his body up and he'll go by himself. Until then, this is my job. I can't ask my wife to do it as she has an even harder time getting back to sleep than I do. \n\nI am working on various solutions. Coffee, for one. Keto diet helps me to stay more alert, and consuming matcha seems to help. I am toying with taking a 20 minute nap every afternoon but that is basically impossibly 3 out of 5 work days, normally. I guess I just have to stick it out until he's older. Which will happen faster than I think. Lots of parents would love it if this was their biggest problem.\n\nAnyway, that's life.

					"body": "So, I have to use this software every day as part of my job. Here are some thoughts:\n\n- Search results should be improved - when I am looking at search results it would be great to be able to bookmark or add a debug point directly from the results. I get around this by docking search results in the left gutter, then as you run through them the file viewing buffer (middle pane) follows your clicks and you can do what you need to do there.\n\n- Speed - I would love if it made easier to figure out what is triggering all the background jobs. I have been trying for months to figure out how to turn off this one feature I am not using but which causes VS to churn for minutes at a time, occasionally.\n\n- Starting up debug threads - I have NO idea how you would do this but it would be nice if, when I am attaching to an IIS thread, it was faster. I know it is our crazy codebase full of massive DLLs that is slowing this down but it would still be nice if it were magically faster. 😭 One thing I do know is if I were to wipe my system and reinstall, it would be very, very fast and slowly slow down over time. I'd like to be able to figure out why this is happening.\n\nHaving said that, I do love the IDE in the way you love your family. This is my IDE and no matter how much I love Emacs, Linux, make files, and other software, I'll always come back to VS because it is what I know best, and the is the best tool for my particular job. While working in Windows I have tried to use Emacs as my main editor when not in VS and even went so far as to use Emacs keybindings in Visual Studio but I always end up reverting back (and using Visual Studio Code as my non-IDE editor). \n\nOne change I did make to VS Code after my last attempt is I replaced Ctrl-p with Alt-x to invoke commands (like Emacs) which has made the editor feel much more natural to me since in Emacs I use helm and hit Meta-x then type commands - this is essentially how VS Code works. \n\nTags #code",

					"title": "Stay Young",
					"body": "\u003e \"Youth is wasted on the young\" -- attributed to [George Bernard Shaw](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/09/07/young/)\n\nI am not sure I really believe that but what I would say is that young people often do not really appreciate what they have. As you get older, your body deteriorates in various ways. Some people are better than others at preventing this decline. I tried. I mean for years I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted but I also did Karate, ran, surfed, meditated and tried in various ways to stay healthy.\n\nBut there were problems:\n\n- Software - my brain liked to stay up ALL NIGHT. No matter how much I meditated or exercised, I had really bad insomnia since I was a teenager. This is mostly gone now. I also was bothered by anxiety, and still am. These two factors really have an impact. They keep stress levels high, which is harmful.\n\n- Hardware - my body fights itself. I have a combo of Ankylosing Spondylitis and Crohns Disease. Nice. Inflammation causes chronic pain. This made exercise hard but still, I pushed on, I tried to get enough sleep. Then there was the operation. I now have an ileostomy and have for a few years. This alleviated a lot of the pain. But that left my abs weak and that makes your core weak. \n\nSince the operation, as I got stronger I have tried to get back to something like good health. I am doing #keto to try to drop some weight and get back into a healthy weight. I try to do pushups which strengthen the core and back.\n\nSo this brings me to the inspiration for this post. About two weeks ago I started in a more focused exercise routine. This involved push ups. I was feeling pretty good and overdid it. I did too many push ups and I used a pull up bar on the floor so they were inclined pushups. I overdid it. This led to chest inflammation in my sternum. Only this morning did it stop hurting really bad and go to an ache. This is probably a result of not being in good shape and aggravated by AS. \n\nBut the recovery time is time is what is brutal. When I was in my 20's this would have been an issue for a few days, maybe a week. Now it's two weeks in and still feeling it. I am worried about doing push ups. I have been stretching that area out. I will ease back into pushups by doing them on the stairs, gradually working down to the lowest stair, then the floor. I will work up to more reps. And so on. But it is slow going.\n\nThe lesson: don't let yourself get out of shape, keep what you have, and make yourself better every day or, one day, you'll look back and wish you had. \n\nTags: #keto, #health\n\n",

					"title": "Morning Routine",
					"body": "This morning, my routine is saving me a little. As the parent of a pre-schooler, I am used to him running into our room in the middle of the night with various concerns. Last night, I read a little, dozed until 10:30pm, woke up to my watch alarm, took the boy to the washroom (as I do each night at that time) and returned to bed. Routine.\n\nThen a hour or so later, our son burst into the room saying “my dreams aren't working!!”. Ha ha. Adrenalin coursing through my veins, I calmly ushered him back to his bed and tucked him in, soothing him into sleep. Wide awake, I read some more. BTW: #reading The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet. Just started it.\n\nNow, I'm on high alert. Then my watch says “CHARGED UNTIL MORNING”. The buzzing wakes me up as if it were an alarm and I slowly understand what happened and go back to sleep (again). And so on. Oh, and the comforter reeked of the dog so I kept shoving the covers away from my face (it's like -40C outside so this made me cold).\n\nSo a great sleep.\n\nYet, I'm here at my desk, up and ready to go. I should point out that because of time zones I need to wake up by 4:30AM here and be working (at home) at my desk by 5AM.\n\nHow?\n\nThe night before:\n\n- laid clothes out\n\n- put headphones in bathroom with clothes\n\n- phone charged and in bathroom (out of reach of bed)\n\n\nThis means I was not “on my phone” when I woke up, keeping me awake longer, instead I was on my Kobo. Way less stimulating. So although I had periods of wakefulness I minimized them. And the headphones mean as soon as I wake up I can throw on a podcast or music to wake up my brain. So no groggy roaming aimlessly looking for clothes for the day. I got up, threw the phones on, and got dressed.\n\nFinally, I didn't have to screw around with coffee because I have a jug of cold brew in the fridge. Just need to pour that into a glass with ice and cream and I'm drinking coffee. Is this the BEST way to wake up when it is the dead of Winter? No but it is fast and here I am.\n\nI'm awake and even ahead of schedule enough to write a blog entry!\n\nTags: #blog",

Got dinner prep done.\n\nI am listening to Russel Brand talking to Megan Jayne Crabbe and really asking myself if my wife and I should stop discussing Keto around our son in any way other than just saying “this food makes me feel better”. The other day (he's 4) he said his belly was too big. Made me feel terrible. We do so much to not create weird attidudes about food but it sounds like our attempt to get healthier (part of which is “weight”) is rubbing off on him in a way that is creating a negative body image. Not great. We'll turn it around.\n\nTags: #keto, #SITREP",

Hopefully, it will work out. It's the first time I've used xylitol but I've baked with the other ingredients a few times.\n\nEdit: these were not awesome. I didn't have the whey protein isolate and substituted a different protein powder so maybe that was the problem. Not gross, just not awesome.\n\nThe issue I have with eating these substitute foods to satisfy a craving is they don't satisfy the craving and are still relatively high in carbs and calories. I think you are better off waiting until you reach your goal or are ready for a cheat day (not endorsing that!).",

					"body": "So weight loss has slowed but I should still end up around 250 by the end of March which would be over 25lbs down. This is according to a linear projection which, as we all know, is not something to bet the farm on. However, I would say with near certainty I’ll be down under 260 which would still be a big milestone for me.\n\nOne of the key reasons I have been eating “keto” has been the much lower inflammation that I experience on it. But lately (like for 2 weeks) I am still fine everywhere except my sciatic nerve (which, ironically, does NOT bother me even when my arthritis is acting up). This seems to be a common complaint among people eating very low carb. No source I have found has explained HOW these two things are related but they seem to be anecdotally linked, at least.\n\nAnyway, the things I have found that help are:\n\n- stretching and exercising a little before bed – around 8pm or so I go down to the basement and do a set of stretches prescribed by physio and also some Tai Chi stuff (mostly Dan Yu). I do a little light cardio (running in place, mostly). Also, specific stretches during the day for sciatica relief.\n- tons of water – I am told drinking tons of water is good.\n- standing desk – as much as I can, I use my desk in the standing position. I have a stool I can lean on as well when standing which makes it easier to spend longer periods of time standing up.\nI have experienced various levels of chronic pain for years. Mostly arthritic. I can handle it. But this has been rough. And it came after nearly total relief for a few weeks. It is bad enough that I can’t sleep. So I need to figure this out! I am hopeful it will “work itself out” as so many other things have done if I just stay the course. If anyone one reading this blog (ha ha ha, good one) has any insight into the root cause of sciatica related to keto, please let me know in the comments.\n\nTags: #keto",

					"body": "This was a pretty action-packed weekend. We got a ton of organizing done which involved assembling a lot of Ikea storage. A little trick I used was to wrap the end of those cheap Allen Keys with painters tape. This means the “turn, turn, turn” motion where you are drilling in those long bolts are much easier on the fingers.\n\nThis also freed up a bunch of old storage that had been toy room storage built using a bunch of blue recycling bins. Since these are freed up I can use them in the garage for a much more organized recycling set up (currently a pile of loosely tied bags I untie and haul into the kitchen every couple of nights and separate an overflowing bin into).\n\nHealth-wise, not a great weekend. Definitely wrenched my back coming down the stairs, didn't get enough sleep, and no stretching or real walking to speak of. However, I did manage to get a lot of movement in with all the cleaning and assembling. Plus some shoveling. All good.\n\nTags: #sitrep",

My wife is reading to my son in his room as he prepares for bed. We are far enough North that it is \\\nstill sunny at his bedtime which makes this a very challenging bedtime for about half the year.\n\nHere are some bullet points on what I have learned this year:\n\n- Carbs – they sound fun but being really stuffed full of them isn't great. Next year I'll eat the fried chicken but not the fries or roll. Keto Brownies instead of cake!\n- Lightning – it's no joke, folks.\n- Sleep – I am going to start taking melatonin at 9pm from now on. When you sleep 5 hours a night you can't afford to have that sleep be inconsistent or broken. I always forget to take melatonin and then it's after midnight and I'm wide awake. I've been dealing with insomnia my entire adult life. When it is light outside until 10:30 and you are not getting enough exercise bedtime can be challenging. And this low carb diet we've been doing for the last three months (see #1, I regret #1) has given me a lot of energy. Turning that off and dropping off to sleep is not easy. So melatonin.\n- Don't leave Fiddler or SQL Profile running unless you have capture paused. You can take that to the bank.\n- I still like punk rock. But after an hour I'm ready for something a little more relaxed. I test it out every year. I was like that when I was in late teens too, so I guess people really don't change?\n\nMy new wallet is still on the way but is in Vancouver now so that's good. I guess I'll get it Monday or Tuesday.\n\nTags: #blog",

					"title": "Coffee Tips (Espresso)",
					"body": "Discussing using home prosumer espresso machines with a co-worker and wrote up a summary of what I have learned over the years.\n\n   - Save your money and buy pre-ground Illy espresso... a grinder good enough for grinding espresso is very, very expensive and Illy, while expensive, is an excellent quality espresso ground perfectly for \"prosumer\" machines. Take some time to calculate how much \"extra\" you are paying for Illy per pound over a good coffee you would grind yourself. Then divide that into the cost of really good grinder (one you would not be disappointed with).\n   - Don't use the milk frother... buy a $10 - $40 milk frother that warms and \"whisks\" the milk on the countertop. Prosumer machines rarely froth milk efficiently and it's a pain to clean them...\n   - Fill the espresso basket until it is rounded over the top then apply 10lbs of force with the tamper... you can \ndo this on a bathroom scale to get the force right... it only takes a few tries to figure it out... this gets a good\n pack for the slightly underpowered home machine normals can afford\n   - Penultimately, use \"preinfusion\". Some prosumer models pre-infuse automatically but basically: run the water pu\nmp until you see a drip of espresso and then turn it off as fast as you can (quicker the better but I have had this \nwork even after 1/4 of the cup got extracted). Let it sit for say 20 -30 seconds, then turn the water back on... thi\ns produces WAY better espresso...\n   - And also finally, if making capucinno just make the coffee into a low coffee cup and pull more than an espresso\n shot, it's fine.\n\nThe espresso machine I use now is the Breville Cafe Roma: https://www.amazon.ca/Breville-Caf%C3%A9-Espresso-Machine-\nESP8XL/dp/B0002VAFWA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1528408112\u0026sr=8-1\u0026keywords=cafe+roma\n\nThe frother we are using is the Brewberry Electric Milk Frother \u0026 Heater, Stainless Steel: https://www.amazon.ca/Bre\nwberry-Electric-Frother-Heater-Stainless/dp/B01GQQZ64G/ref=sr_1_7?s=kitchen\u0026ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1528408159\u0026sr=1-7\n\nIlly Espresso: https://www.amazon.ca/Ground-Espresso-Roast-Coffee-Packaging/dp/B007PDDDWC/ref=pd_sbs_325_2?_encoding\n=UTF8\u0026pd_rd_i=B007PDDDWC\u0026pd_rd_r=c9634abe-6a9c-11e8-8e75-010044d11cdd\u0026pd_rd_w=1cR4k\u0026pd_rd_wg=PowgZ\u0026pf_rd_i=desktop-d\np-sims\u0026pf_rd_m=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB\u0026pf_rd_p=3743643050606576516\u0026pf_rd_r=2N8NNQHQJRDCC259SK06\u0026pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims\u0026pf_rd\n_t=40701\u0026psc=1\u0026refRID=2N8NNQHQJRDCC259SK06\n\n",

It's three weeks.\n\nPros:\n\n- I get out for more walks. His little legs need to be exercised or his aging body ends up peeing in the house.\n- My son is helping to get him into and out of his kennel and it is one of his first “chores”. He loves it.\n- The dog is gentle with people and is often good company for our full time dog.\n- Can be hilarious. He has giant eyes and lays down with his legs splayed out behind him.\n\nCons:\n\n- Gassy. So very, very gassy. It is probably his food but we can't change it for such a short time. There will be the sound of an air brake or compressed air tool and then, bam, it hits you. I can't describe the smell.\n- Noisy. Eating? Obsessively licking his paws? Sleeping? Walking around? He breathes like he has a constant nasal obstruction. It is pretty gross sounding.\n- Annoying. Our dog is constantly being molested by this dog from about 6pm until 8pm. The rest of the time it is fine. But those 2 hours? Chaos. Running around the house, jumping on furniture, shifting rugs, barking outside, chaos.\n- Extra work. As a poop machine, his job is to poop several times a day and my job is to clean it. As an indoor peeing machine, his job is to try to not pee outside and my job is to take him on multiple walks each day presenting various objects that are so tempting to pee on that he can't help himself. This takes place right before or after things where I would rather not be outside right away (bed, arriving home from errands, eating lunch, etc). \n\nAnyway, we're over halfway through and I like the little guy despite all this. He's noisily licking his paws under my desk right now (where he spends most of the day) and I'm waiting for the next wave of stench to emerge.\n\nTags: #blog",
